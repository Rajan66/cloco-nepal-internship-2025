# Webpage using Semantic HTML and modern CSS

## Objective
This project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML elements and modern CSS techniques to create a responsive webpage. The page includes a navigation bar, a responsive gallery, sticky sidebar, and card layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## Tasks Implemented

### 1. Created Semantic HTML Structure
- Used <header>, <nav>, <article>, <figure>, <aside>, and <footer> tags to structure the page.
- The navigation bar includes links for "Home", "Gallery", and "Contact".
- Implemented a gallery of images and a sidebar with sticky positioning.

### 2. Responsive Layout with Flexbox and Grid
- Used Flexbox to create a responsive navigation bar.
- Used CSS Grid to create a page layout that adjusts for different screen sizes:
	- Grid Layout: The main content is displayed in a two-column layout (2fr and 1fr) on larger screens, and switches to a single column on smaller screens.
	- Responsive Gallery: The gallery layout adjusts from 1 column to 2 columns on medium screens and 3 columns on large screens.

### 3. Sticky Sidebar
- Implemented a sticky sidebar that remains visible while scrolling the page using position: sticky.

### 4. Hover and Focus Effects
- Added hover effects on navigation items and a clickable hamburger menu on smaller screens.

### 5. Accessibility Considerations
- Ensured a proper color contrast for readability.
- Added alt attributes to images for screen reader accessibility.
- Implemented a semantic structure for better SEO and user experience.

## How to Run 
- Download the HTML and CSS files to your local system.
- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
- The webpage will automatically adjust for different screen sizes, with a responsive navigation bar and gallery layout.
