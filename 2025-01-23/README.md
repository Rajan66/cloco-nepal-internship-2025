# HTML and JavaScript Table Manipulation

## Objective
This project demonstrates the use of HTML, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation techniques to create an interactive table generator with dynamic functionalities. It allows users to input row and column values, generate a table, and interact with the table through various features such as adding rows, deleting rows, and applying themes.

## Tasks Implemented

### 1. Table Generation
- Created a dynamic table generator using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
- Users can specify the number of rows and columns using input fields.
- The table displays headers and cells with dynamically assigned content.
- Added validation for clearing previous tables before generating a new one

### 2. Theme Application
- Implemented a dropdown menu to switch between three themes:
    - Default: Gray background with default styling.
    - Light: White background with gray table styling.
    - Dark: Black background with green table styling.
- Changes the body and table colors dynamically.
